## Awesome Seaborn Tutorial: My Personal Notes from Beginner to Advanced  ðŸš€

When I want to learn something, I always try to create my own notes so that I can learn them for a long time. I don't like tutorial hell because when you learn from a tutorial, after watching, itâ€™s erased from your brain. Also, when you visit some websites, there are a lot of ads that distract you, and you can't focus on learning.

That's why I created these notes on Seaborn, which cover all the topics from beginner to advanced. I put a lot of effort into them. I have my notes on all artificial intelligence topics, and I will only share them further if I get a response. So please learn from these and also share them with others.
